==============================================================================

Thank you for purchasing the Extreme Pinball CD.  The CD version of Extreme
Pinball has a few minor differences from the disk version, noted below.

Install Program
---------------

To install Extreme Pinball:

  1. Place the CD in your CD-ROM drive.
  2. Change to the CD-ROM drive (for example, D: )
  3. Type INSTALL.

The install program will allow you to read Extreme Pinball's documentation,
install the game, and install your Epic Bonus games.

Installing The Game
-------------------

You can perform either a Full Installation or Partial Installation of Extreme
Pinball from your CD.

Full Install:
  A full installation requires approximately 14 MB of hard drive space to
  copy all of Extreme Pinball's files to your hard disk.  The CD is not
  needed to play the game if you perform a full installation.

Partial Install:
  A partial installation requires approximately 200 KB of hard drive space
  to copy the necessary files to your hard disk.  To play Extreme Pinball,
  you will need to place the Extreme Pinball CD in your CD-ROM drive and
  type EXTRTEME from the root directory on your CD.

  NOTE: Due to excessive loading time, it is highly recommended that you
  perform a full installation unless you meet the following system
  specifications: Quad-speed (or faster) CD-ROM and 8 or more MB of RAM.

Bonus Games
-----------

Your Extreme Pinball CD also contains the shareware versions of three other
hot Epic titles: Radix: Beyond The Void, Tyrian, and Jazz Jackrabbit (Turtle
Terror and Holiday Hare).  These games must be installed to your hard drive
before you can play them.  Installing these files can easily be done from
the INSTALL menu program.

Problems?
---------

If your encounter any problems with your Extreme Pinball CD, please read the
troubleshooting information in the online manual, either from the INSTALL 
program or by typing HELPME at the command prompt from the root directory on
the CD.


Enjoy!
