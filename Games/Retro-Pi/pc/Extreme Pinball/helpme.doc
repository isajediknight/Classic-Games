		      Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================

Running with Windows
---------------------

Extreme Pinball does not run reliably under Windows 3.0 or 3.1 with sound
on.  Please run SETUP from DOS and select "No Sound Card" if you
need to run Extreme Pinball from older versions of Windows.  If you
still have problems, exit Windows and run Extreme Pinball from DOS.

Extreme Pinball should work under Windows 95 on most computers.  However,
if you have any problems running under Windows 95, you'll have to run
it from MS-DOS Mode instead.

Note: Under Windows 95, Extreme Pinball won't run quite as smoothly
      as under DOS.  You may notice the screen flickering from time
      to time.  Though this shouldn't affect gameplay, if you prefer
      total smoothness, we recommend running from MS-DOS mode.

Running with OS/2
-----------------

Though Extreme Pinball may work reliably under OS/2 on some computers, we
don't recommend this because it might result in the game locking up.
Please run through DOS, instead.

Running on 4-megabyte machines
------------------------------

Extreme Pinball takes up nearly 4 megabytes of memory.  It will
run on 4-meg machines, but only if you don't have other device
drivers or memory managers loaded.

If Extreme refuses to run, and you have a 4-meg machine, install
it to your hard disk (by running Setup and choosing "Full install").
Then, boot clean and run Extreme from the hard drive.  This usually
solves the problem because CD-Rom device drivers take up a lot of
memory and may prevent Extreme from running on 4-meg machines.

		      HOW TO BOOT YOUR COMPUTER CLEAN
=============================================================================
			    
If you're having problems running Extreme Pinball, you might be able to get
it up and running by "Booting your computer clean."  By this, we mean
starting your computer without loading all of the memory managers and device
drivers that might interfere with the game.  It's a relatively simple process,
so please bear with us.

=============================================================================
                        Booting your computer clean
=============================================================================

Reboot your computer by pressing RESET or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Wait for the
message "Starting MS-DOS..." to come up.  Now press the [F5] key.

This will cause DOS 6.0 to bypass all of your TSR's, memory managers,
and other programs which normally occupy main memory.

Now change into the EXTREME directory and begin the game.

=============================================================================
			  GENERAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================================================================

Q: When I run Extreme,  the computer locks up or reboots.
A: Run SETUP and verify that your settings are correct. If you are
   not using a sound card, make sure that SETUP is set for "No Sound Card".
   If you are using a sound card, verify that your sound card has no
   address, IRQ, or DMA conflicts with other peripherals in your system.
   If your sound card works properly with other games, you can assume that
   there are no conflicts.  However, if your sound card does not work with
   other games, you have a conflict.  See your sound card manual
   for details on fixing this.

Q: Extreme runs slowly on my 386 or 486 computer.  What can I do?
A: Your computer or VGA card isn't as fast as the game would like.
   If you're running through Windows, try running Extreme Pinball
   from DOS instead.

Q: While playing, I get dumped back to DOS with an error message. 
A: This means that either (1) Extreme is conflicting with your memory
   managers and TSR's, or (2) you need more free memory to run Extreme.
   Try booting clean.

Q: I can't seem to get anything on the screen.  I type Extreme and the system
   "hangs".  What now?
A: Make sure you have the system requirements mentioned earlier in the
   manual. If you do, you may have TSR's that conflict with Extreme. Remove
   the TSR's and try running Extreme with a "clean boot" from a DOS
   diskette.  Also try running Extreme without sound, to determine if there
   is a sound-related conflict.

=============================================================================
			     SOUND CARD NOTES
=============================================================================

   Since new models of sound cards are always being manufactured and revised,
   sometimes a new sound card will come out that's not compatible with
   Extreme Pinball.  To determine whether you are having a sound-related
   conflict, try setting up Extreme Pinball for "No Sound Card."  If the
   game works without sound, but locks up with sound on, chances are that you
   are having a sound-related conflict.

   Here's how to contact the top sound card makers for information about
   sound card problems and obtaining the latest driver files.
