* DEFAULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
*
* ACCELERATION = 0.019532
*   Rate of acceleration of ball
*
* BALL_VMAXX = 4
*   Maximum velocity of a ball in the x (horizontal) direction
*
* BALL_VMAXY = 6.666666
*   Maximum velocity of a ball in the y (vertical) direction
*
* NORMALDAMPING = 0.75


NORMALDAMPING = 0.65


* NORMALDAMPING_X = 1.0
* NORMALDAMPING_Y = 1.0
*   Coefficient of velocity retention during a collision with wall pixel.
*   or (stationary) flipper  (_X & _Y allows tweaking if necessary)
*
* FLIPPERNORMAL_X = 1.0
* FLIPPERNORMAL_Y = 1.0
*
*   Allows tweaking of the normal of a flipper impact.
*
* FLIPPERVELOCITY_X = 1.0
* FLIPPERVELOCITY_Y = 1.0
*   Allows tweaking of change in velocity due to flipper impact.
*
* INTERELASTICITY = 0.610351 
*   Coefficient of velocity retention during a collision with another ball.
*
* WEIGHT_NEW = 1
* WEIGHT_OLD = 5
*   The ratio WEIGHT_NEW : WEIGHT_OLD determines how far the scrolling
*   mechanism scrolls.  Moves WEIGHT_NEW of (WEIGHT_NEW + WEIGHT_OLD) 
*   parts of the way from the old scroll position to the new scroll 
*   position. 
*   Actual position is calculated as follows:
*      ROW_NEW = (ROW_NEW * WEIGHT_NEW + ROW_OLD * WEIGHT_OLD) 
*                / (WEIGHT_NEW + WEIGHT_OLD)
*
* SCROLL_MAX = 20
*   The maximum number of rows the table image is allowed to scroll
*   in one redraw.
*
* PLUNGER_MAX_VELOCITY = 6.666666
*   Velocity of the ball after plunger impacts from maximum displacement
*
* NUDGE_STRENGTH = 1.5
*   Velocity change of the ball during a table nudge
*
* NUDGE_SENSITIVITY = 1
*   Amount of agitation nudge sensor receives during a table nudge
*
* NUDGE_TOLERANCE = 4.6875
*   Maximum amount of nudge
*
* NUDGE_DECAY = 0.010406
*   Time of nudge
*
* MUSIC_VOLUME = 127
*   Master volume level for music (0..127)
*
* SAMPLE_VOLUME = 127
*   Master volume level for sound effects  (0..127)
