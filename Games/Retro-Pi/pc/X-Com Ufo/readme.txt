             X-COM: UFO Defense
           Update to version 1.4
                Read Me file
                October 1996
        ============================

Please read this entire text file before installing
the update to version 1.4 for X-COM: UFO Defense. Then
choose one of the four update methods depending on 
whether you have the floppy disk or CD-ROM version of
X-COM and if you are updating to version 1.4 using an
update disk or the downloaded patch file.

Updating the Floppy Disk Version with the Update Disk
-----------------------------------------------------
1)  Insert the update disk into your floppy disk drive.

2)  At the DOS prompt, type "CD\MPS\UFO" to change to the 
    X-COM directory on your hard drive. (If you chose 
    a different directory when you installed the game, 
    substitute that name instead.)

3)  Type "COPY A:\*.*" at the DOS prompt. Type "A" if you
    are asked if you wish to overwrite files.

4)  Once the files are finished copying, type "UPDATE"
    at the DOS prompt.

5)  Once the update is finished, type "SETUP" and select 
    your sound options.

6)  After your copy of X-COM is updated to version 1.4, be 
    sure to start a new game by changing to the X-COM 
    directory ("CD\MPS\UFO") and then running the game 
    ("UFO"). Unfortunately, your saved games are not 
    compatible with the new version so be sure to select 
    "New Game" instead of "Load Saved Game" at the first
    game menu.
   
Updating the CD-ROM Version With the Update Disk
------------------------------------------------
1)  You will need to copy all the files from your X-COM 
    CD-ROM to your hard drive. First, change to the hard
    drive where you want to install X-COM by typing 
    "C:" (if your hard drive is a letter other than C, 
    substitute that letter instead).

2)  Create the directory on your hard drive for X-COM by
    typing "MD\MPS" and then "MD\MPS\UFO" at the DOS prompt.

3)  Change to the X-COM directory by typing "CD\MPS\UFO" 
    at the DOS prompt.

4)  Type "XCOPY D:\*.* /S /E" at the DOS prompt. (If your 
    CD-ROM drive is a letter other than D, substitute that 
    letter instead.)

5)  Change to the drive where you installed X-COM by typing 
    "C:" (if you installed X-COM to a drive other than C, 
    substitute that letter instead).

6)  Change to the directory where you installed X-COM by
    typing "CD\MPS\UFO."

7)  To install the update, insert the update disk into your
    floppy disk drive.

8)  Type "COPY A:\*.*" at the DOS prompt. Type "A" if you
    are asked if you wish to overwrite files.

9)  Once the files are finished copying, type "UPDATE" at
    the DOS prompt.

10) Once the update is finished, type "SETUP" and select
    your sound options.

11) After your copy of X-COM is updated to version 1.4, be 
    sure to start a new game by changing to the X-COM 
    directory ("CD\MPS\UFO") and then running the game 
    ("UFO"). Unfortunately, your saved games are not 
    compatible with the new version so be sure to select 
    "New Game" instead of "Load Saved Game" at the first
    game menu.

Updating the Floppy Disk Version With the Downloaded Update
-----------------------------------------------------------
1)  Change to the drive where you installed X-COM by typing
    "C:" (if you installed the game to a hard drive other than 
    C, substitute that letter instead).

2)  Change to the directory where you installed X-COM by 
    typing "CD\MPS\UFO" (if you installed the game to a 
    different directory, substitute that name instead).

3)  Copy the downloaded update (XCOM14.ZIP) into your X-COM
    directory.

4)  You need to unzip the update file in the X-COM directory. 
    Type "PKUNZIP XCOM14.ZIP" at the DOS prompt.

5)  Once the files are finished unzipping, type "UPDATE"
    at the DOS prompt.

6)  Once the update is finished, type "SETUP" and select 
    your sound options.

7)  After your copy of X-COM is updated to version 1.4, be 
    sure to start a new game by changing to the X-COM 
    directory ("CD\MPS\UFO") and then running the game 
    ("UFO"). Unfortunately, your saved games are not
